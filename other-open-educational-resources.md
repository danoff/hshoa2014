# Similar classes and open educational resources

This list collects similar classes and related Open Educational Resources (OER)
on digital libraries, open access, open science and other library and
information science (LIS) topics. Focus of this list should be German resources
and classes, but little of these seem to exists by now (February 2014).

*Feel free to add more resources by raising an issue at
<https://github.com/jakobib/hshoa2014/issues> or creating a pull request!*

## Classes, courses and textbooks

*The current list contains much computer-science, more on media, archiving, society
etc. should be added.*

* Several classes at GitHub, but only computer science so far (?). A quick
  search for "syllabus" in GitHub resulted in many accounts and repositories,
  such as:

## Related lists and collections

[Free Programming Books](http://resrc.io/list/10/list-of-free-programming-books/)
(also hosted [in a git repository](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)
contains several free books, some of them cover topics related to LIS
(information retrieval, data science, licenses etc.).

Several resources exist to find Online Courses (MOOC, etc.) but no course in
library science so far (?).

## About reusable OER classes in general

### Syllabi

* In [2010 David Weinberger proposed](https://davidweinberger.sys-con.com/node/1503012)
  to create a standard for sharing syllabi. Wikipedia describes a syllabus as
  "an outline and summary of topics to be covered in an education or training
  course", but the use and structure of syllabi differs among cultures. Same
  applies to software such as BlackBoard, Moodle, Sakai etc. A nice quote 
  [from](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/syllixml/?title=Questions&diff=prev&oldid=30)
  the (oprhaned) project page

  > Hey there, I love your project and I am really happy to contribute to it. I am
  > Italian, and I have to say that I had some hard time just understanding the
  > concept of syllabi. In Italy we certainly have a list of books recommended or
  > required, but how the program develops along the semester is often a mystery.
  > Is the database going to be flexible enough to consider different models of
  > education? 

* The [Open Syllabus Project](http://opensyllabusproject.org/) (OSP) is a more
  recent, promising project to collect syllabi. It's most important decision
  seems to be using natural language processing to extract structured data from
  existing syllabi instead of trying to enforce a standard format (but software
  contains implicit data assumptions as well).

### OER as building blocks

* The [Connexions Library](http://cnx.org/) groups OER content in " *modules*,
  which are like small 'knowledge chunks,' and *collections*, which are groups
  of modules structured into books or course notes, or for other uses. All
  content is licensed under CC-BY.
