# Similar classes and open educational resources

This list collects similar classes and related Open Educational Resources (OER)
on digital libraries, open access, open science and other library and
information science (LIS) topics. Focus of this list should be German resources
and classes, but little of these seem to exists by now (February 2014).

*Feel free to add more resources by raising an issue at
<https://github.com/jakobib/hshoa2014/issues> or creating a pull request!*

[Free Programming Books](http://resrc.io/list/10/list-of-free-programming-books/)
(also hosted [in a git repository](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)
contains several free books, some of them cover topics related to LIS
(information retrieval, data science, licenses etc.).

Several resources exist to find Online Courses (MOOC, etc.) but no course in
library science so far (?).
